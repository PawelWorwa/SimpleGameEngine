Firstly, it’s not really an engine. Reason why creating one is generally bad idea was well described [here](https://geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/write-games-not-engines/).

What is it then? Mearly my implementation of two gaming patterns: “Game loop” and “State” combined (something that I’m using in most of my projects and never really found well explained when used together). 

Engine implementation is within "engine” folder. Everything within "states" folder is made only to check if everything works.
